    <h1>Heisenberg The Cook</h1>
    <H3>METH</H3>
    <p>In one stroke, he bloodied both sides - set the American and Mexican governments against the Cartel, and cut off the supply of <strong>methamphetamine</strong> to the southwest. If this man had his own source of product on this side of the border, he would have the market to himself. The rewards would be... <strong><em>enormous</em></strong>.</p>

    <H3>MY LIFE</H3>
    <p>We're both adults. I can't pretend I don't know that person is you. I want there to be no confusion. I know I owe you my life. And more than that, I respect the strategy. In your position, I would have done the same. One issue, which troubles me, I don't know what happens when our three-month contract ends. You know why I do this. I want security for my family.</p>

    <H3>THE DEA</H3>
    <p>No speeches. Short speech. You lost your partner today. What's his name - Emilio? Emilio is going to prison. <strong>The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square one.</strong> But you know the business and I know the chemistry. I'm thinking... maybe you and I could partner up. </p>
    
    <h3><em>REGRETS</h3></em>
    I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes, that stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. You see, <em>hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic.</em> It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic. So there's that. How about something with some protein, maybe? Something green, huh? <strong><em>How are you even alive? </strong></em>
